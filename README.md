# EPPMS

EPPMS stands for Event Publication and Poster Management System is a special project created by Aaron Angelo Vicuna in compliance with requirements for completion of his Master of Information Systems degree at University of the Philippines Open University.

Events publication and posters complement each other in information dissemination and marketing activities. Commonly, multiple applications are utilized to perform the activities and generate the media files involved. The developer of the project proposed to create a system that bridges the gap between the event publication and poster generation activities using web-based technologies. This simplifies the requirement to use multiple applications in performing these tasks in an organization. Furthermore, reducing the time and effort required in familiarization on the usage and workflow of multiple applications previously involved in the activity.
